Probably the most difficult thing is to guess what exactly an author means in every single sentence of his/her text. Manuscriptedit caught very well what I wanted to express in the text I submitted. This must have been difficult with my manuscript because not only I wrote it by myself (I am not fluent in english) but also the manuscript did not undergo preliminary proofread prior its submission to Manuscriptedit. I do appreciate your job. Also I notice with pleasure that you have completed editing before the deadline which was April 1st. Thank you for this.",
