                Reseapro Scientific Services (P) Ltd. may collect certain
                aggregate data called web log information (such as your web
                browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use cookies
                (see below) when you visit any of our web pages. For instance,
                when you visit one of our websites, our web server will
                automatically recognize some non-personal information, including
                but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the
                pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the
                type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet
                Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g.,
                Windows '95 or Mac OS), and the domain name and address of your

                return to our site. Most Web browsers automatically accept
                cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that
                if you wish. Whilst Reseapro Scientific Services (P) Ltd. uses
                cookies to track your visit to our site, this information does
                not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you

                In some cases we may also collect information about you that you

                statistical information like age, gender, household size,

              <p>
                We may use your personal information to contact you. For
                example, we may send you marketing or promotional materials
                including emails or other information, we may respond to your
                comments or requests for information or we may contact you, if
                needed, in the course of processing or shipping your order for
                products or services offered through our websites. We may also
                enhance or merge personal information with data obtained from
                third parties for the same purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also use personal information about you to improve our
                marketing and promotional efforts to statistically analyze site
                usage to improve our content and product offerings and to
                customize our sites' content, layout and services. We may also
                use your information to deliver information to you that, in some
                cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners,
                new services and promotions. We believe these uses allow us to
                improve our site and better tailor it to meet our visitors'
                needs. Reseapro Scientific Services (P) Ltd. does not collect
                personal information automatically, but we may combine
                non-personal information collected automatically (e.g., through

              <p>
                Reseapro Scientific Services (P) Ltd. occasionally sends
                visitors emails describing new products, promotions or events.
