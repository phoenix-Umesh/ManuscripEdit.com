                Choosing the appropriate journal for publishing is very crucial
                but tedious process. You may have obtained excellent set of
                results, but if you submit to a journal whose scope and target
                audience are irrelevant, there is a little chance of getting
                published. Our experienced editors, (some of them are also
                reviewer of reputed journals) with vast experience in editing
                and publishing articles, will help you to select the correct
                journal where the chances of getting your work published is
                maximum. They will shortlist 4-5 journals, which suit your
                requirement. They consider certain factors while selecting
                appropriate journals for your manuscript. Here we list few
                factors as example:
